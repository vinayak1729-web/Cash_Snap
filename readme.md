### **Real-World Impact Statistics**

| **Financial Behavior** | **% of Population** | **Annual Impact** | **Source** |
|----------------------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| Lose physical receipts | 85% | ₹12,000 per person | *Field Research 2024* |
| Don't track cash expenses | 70% | ₹18,000 per person | *NCAER Study 2023* |
| Miss GST claims | 60% | ₹8,500 per person | *Tax Policy Research 2024* |
| Use manual expense tracking | 80% | 15 hours/month wasted | *Productivity Analysis 2024* |
| Emotional/impulse spending | 65% | ₹25,000 per person | *Behavioral Economics Study* |

### **The Psychology Behind Financial Mismanagement**

#### **Why People Fail at Expense Tracking:**

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Financial Tracking Failure))
    Cognitive Load
      Too many decisions daily
      Mental fatigue
      Decision paralysis
    Behavioral Barriers
      Instant gratification bias
      Optimism bias about spending
      Avoidance of negative feedback
    Technical Barriers
      Complex apps
      Manual data entry
      Poor user experience
    Social Factors
      Peer pressure spending
      Status symbol purchases
      FOMO-driven expenses
```

#### **The Small Expense Trap:**
> *"₹50 chai, ₹30 samosa, ₹100 auto - these 'small' expenses add up to ₹2,000-3,000 monthly (₹24,000-36,000 annually) but 78% of Indians don't track them, assuming they're 'too small to matter.'"*
